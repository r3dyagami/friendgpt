# FINAL SOLUTION FOR VERCEL IMAGE ISSUE

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment is using the `main` branch, but all our fixes are on `clean-main` branch.

## Solution Options (Choose ONE):

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# 1. Make sure you're logged in
npx vercel login

# 2. Deploy from clean-main branch
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Dashboard Fix
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to Settings â†’ Git
3. Look for "Production Branch" setting
4. Change from "main" to "clean-main"
5. Save and redeploy

### Option 3: Create New Vercel Project
1. Delete current Vercel project
2. Go to vercel.com/new
3. Import repository
4. **IMPORTANT**: When importing, make sure to select "clean-main" branch

### Option 4: Quick Deploy URL
Since you can't change branch in UI, try this direct deploy URL:
```
https://vercel.com/import/git?s=https://github.com/r3dyagami/friendgpt&branch=clean-main
```

## Verification
After deployment, visit:
- `/test-images.html` - Should show which image formats work
- `/debug.html` - Shows detailed image loading info
- `/image-test.html` - Another test page

## Why This Will Work
- All images are in the root directory on clean-main branch
- All paths are relative (no ./ or / prefix)
- No secrets blocking deployment
- Filename with space has been fixed (naincy-pelosi.jpg)

## If Still Not Working
The issue is 100% that Vercel is deploying from the wrong branch. You MUST deploy from `clean-main` branch where all fixes are implemented.
